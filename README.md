Bill Waldo
========

What is it?
--------
App that tells you that joe owes you Â£20 (split bills / holidays between friends).
See it in action at http://billwaldo.com

Interesting bits
--------
Rails 3.1 (beta)
MongoDB
jQuery
Deployed on Heroku

Trust
--------
Only share bills with people you trust. There's no administrator so if one of your friends is feeling evil they can delete / lie about expenses.

To do
--------
Enhance through layout, images and ajax.

Email people when they are added to a new bill or when a bill moves to the payment phase.

Payment groups - so a couple's payments are combined.

Currency conversions and allow cross-currency expenses in a single bill.

Audit trail - to keep the convenience of the admin-free set-up but cancel out the impact of careless / malicious friends.
